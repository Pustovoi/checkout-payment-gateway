This is one of possible implementations.
Notes about implementation:
- Target framework - .NET Core 2.2
- Main solution parts:
	- Controller with 2 endpoints to process payment and retrieve payment details by id. (Controllers)
	- Stub for bank processing logic (Services)
	- Payment service (Services)
	- Data model (DataModel)
	- Repositories to abstract interaction with data storage level (Repositories)
	- Set of Dtos (Model)
	- Custom validators (Validators)
- Data storage support added (operates with InMemory database)
- Used Autofac as an IoC container 
- Used AutoMapper for data entities conversion 
- Docker support added (Target - Windows containers)
- Covered by xUnit unit tests with usage of Moq and Autofac extensions.

You can find Postman collection for testing purposes in ./Postman
See collection variables and pre-request scripts for variables

Thigs which can be improved, but have not done because of lack of free time:
- Authentication/Autorization support with 3rd party OAuth provider
- Publishing to Azure or Docker hub
- Logging using log4net
- Look for possible encryption options
